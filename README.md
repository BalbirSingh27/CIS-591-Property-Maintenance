## üìåPROPERY MAINTENANCE TRENDS ANALYSIS

### Problem Statement

We are analyzing data on property maintenance issues reported by Phoenix residents to identify neighborhoods with the most complaints and recommend areas where issues are handled well. Our goal is to understand complaint status, how many inspections are needed for resolution, and if there's a link between inspections and problem resolution.

This analysis will offer insights into maintenance concerns and suggest ways to improve services and neighborhood conditions.

### Summary of Insights

- **Districts 5 and 8** report the highest number of complaints, suggesting challenges due to population density or socio-economic conditions.
- **Districts 2 and 6** have the fewest cases and lowest inspection counts, indicating well-managed areas or underreporting.
- Cases with **formal notices or tickets** require more inspections.
- Simpler cases (e.g., resolved without tickets) often need fewer inspections.
- Common complaint types: overgrown grass, weeds, and parking issues.
- These recurring issues highlight the need for **targeted maintenance programs**.
- Focusing resources on high-complaint zones and emulating successful districts can enhance service efficiency.

### Broader Interpretation

- Some neighborhoods report significantly more issues due to socio-economic challenges or better reporting systems.
- **Unresolved cases with multiple inspections** indicate systemic issues or repeat violations.
- A strong correlation exists between **inspection frequency** and **resolution complexity**.
- Outliers (cases requiring very high inspection counts) suggest chronic violations or complicated maintenance issues.
